# Covid-19-Dataset-Analysis
- I have taken the dataset from kaggle . ie. COVID19_line_list_data.csv
- In this analysis it proved that " The people died due to the covid are much more older than the alive people " .
- Also using this dataset it is proved that the " Men death rate is more as compared to the Women death rate " .
